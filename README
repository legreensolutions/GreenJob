 GreenJob will Help in Managing jobs, ie sharing Jobs with others in the system. In GreenJob there are three modules.

 1) User

I preffer the User module will be simple one. Unlike any other system no SignUp is required. On Setup a default "Admin" User is Created and the "Admin" Manages All the User. Admin can add/edit/view/disable User.
On adding a user, a notification mail should be send to the user. The notification mail will Help user to join and Fill the profile.

Default Admin User          :  admin
Default Admin User password :  admin
